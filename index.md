# About Me

I am a software developer with over a decade of professional experience in Financial Software, primarily working with C++, but also JavaScript, Java and other technologies

While I am not an expert in Functional Programming, I have seen the light of FP and believe there's a lot to be gained from making use of FP principles in any language. I try to build software following a philosopy of limiting side-effects as much as possible, and making small, composable parts that can easily be tested and reasoned about.

## Open Source Software

I maintain [a fork of the "Perforce for VS Code" extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mjcrouch.perforce) and have a strong interest in VS Code / TypeScript-based development

## Other Interests

### Software, etc.

I also like to dabble in other projects in my free time. Over the years I have:

* Built and published (briefly) an Android game in java using libgdx, including scoreboards, facebook integration using the graph API and other exciting features that no longer see the light of day
* Explored VR game development using Unity / C# - I am a member of the Oculus Start developer program
* Used microcontrollers / embedded programming in C++ to create [homemade devices](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mattccttam/31730852913/in/photolist-QkWDd4-QkWV5V)
* And more things that must not be notable enough for me to remember them here

### More Things

* I enjoy [photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mattccttam/) - without being particularly good at it or ever having achieved a consistent style
* I also play the piano. If you're really interested in seeing my hands and half a piano, [here is the only video I've seen fit to upload](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDheQRx5eY8) :)

# My Journey in Code (Abridged Edition)

My earliest recollection of coding as a child looks something like this:

```basic
10 PRINT "Hello"
20 GOTO 10
```

But, at such a young age, my main use of the CPC 464 was playing games like [Dizzy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcvjUtyxDNA) and [Stunt Car Racer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dog3F4mpUkA) - although I'm not sure I was capable of completing either of these at the time.

Within a few years of that, I had started building websites. I was a big fan of the game *Worms* and decided to create "Matt's Worms Page". This was my first experience of using code to create something real to share with other people.

After many iterations of websites, I eventually (aged 16) created a community website called [Blame The Pixel](https://web.archive.org/web/20021019040726/http://www.blamethepixel.com/) using PHP and MySQL, and far too many HTML tables (Internet Explorer [only finished implementing full CSS support in the same year the site launched!](https://css-tricks.com/look-back-history-css/)). This included the ability for users to upload and download files and play pointless web-based games, all built from scratch. I even developed a one-of-a-kind forum / bulletin board system.

Of course, the code was ultimately quite ugly and unreliable, but several thousand users joined. We had multiple developers building features, and this was a valuable learning experience that cemented my desire to build software as a career.

As an aside, during all of this early experimentation I also discovered other languages like Pascal (delphi) and Perl, but some things are best forgotten.

I then completed a computer science degree, learning some "Real Code". One might na√Øvely think I was then ready for the real world, but some say I'm still learning to this day...

As this is the abridged edition, you will have to wait for my full autobiography for other riveting tidbits. Alternatively I would probably be willing to sell exclusive rights to my story for a [low low price](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l91ISfcuzDw).

Thank you for reading - if you have read this far down then I must say I really admire your tenacity.
